'''Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).'''
# Define a function named 'perfect_number' that checks if a number 'n' is a perfect number
def perfect_number(n):
    # Initialize a variable 'sum' to store the sum of factors of 'n'
    sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through numbers from 1 to 'n-1' using 'x' as the iterator
    for x in range(1, n):
        # Check if 'x' is a factor of 'n' (divides 'n' without remainder)
        if n % x == 0:
            # If 'x' is a factor of 'n', add it to the 'sum'
            sum += x
    
    # Check if the 'sum' of factors is equal to the original number 'n'
    return sum == n

# Print the result of checking if 6 is a perfect number by calling the 'perfect_number' function
print(perfect_number(6))
